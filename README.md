## Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
* Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
* The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
* [Check out this video of the app for a run-through of how it works.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msvdn95x9OM&feature=youtu.be)

## Tech Used: 
* HTML
* CSS
* node.js
* JS
* MySQL
* Express
* Handlebars

I followed the MVC design pattern using Node and MySQL to query and route data into the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.
